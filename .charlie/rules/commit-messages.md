  - No trailing whitespace
- Body
  - Explain WHY and maybe a bit of HOW
  - Empty line required between title and body
  - Max 116 characters per line (except URLs, code blocks, footer annotations)
  - Minimum 5 characters
- Footer
  - Use trailers:
    - `Reference: https://example.com`
    - `Assisted-by: Tool/Agent (<Model/Version>)`
- AI attribution

  - If you're not sure which model is being used, ask the user or don't mention it.
